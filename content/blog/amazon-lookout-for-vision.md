AWS has announced the release of a handful of products and services geared towards helping industrial customers and partners in their journey to digital transformation. Under the umbrella term of [AWS for Industrial](https://aws.amazon.com/industrial/), these offerings, which include not only services but also devices e.g. [Amazon Monitron](https://aws.amazon.com/monitron/) and full-blown solutions e.g. [Amazon SageMaker for Predictive Maintenance](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/predictive-maintenance-using-machine-learning/), cover a lot of interesting use-cases and industry-relevant workloads in such areas as Production & Asset Optimization and Quality Management.
