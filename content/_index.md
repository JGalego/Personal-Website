## Who am I?

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a certified Physics nerd and an amateur forensic scientist with a keen interest in solving interesting and demanding problems. I've worked as a data analyst, software tester, test automation engineer, DevOps engineer and ML consultant for several companies, in areas ranging from market research to fiber optic telecommunications and mobility. 

Currently, I work as a DevOps engineer and ML consultant at the [Siemens Lisbon Tech Hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVpoZRwASDU), while pursuing a PhD degree in Cognitive Science at [Universidade de Lisboa](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en/). My research focuses on the application of robust ML algorithms to improve the performance of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces.
